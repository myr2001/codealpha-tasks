1. **Iris Flower Classification**
A classification project where I went step by step, first performing data visualization, and then beginning to build an ML model for it.
I utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
I have evaluated the model's performance and analysis using test data.

3. **Unemployment Analysis with Python**
An analysis performed on the unemployment rate data.
I used Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, again utilizing the same libraries.
I have investigated the impact of Covid 19 on unemployment rates.
I have identified key patterns or seasonal trends in data.
I presented insights that could inform economic or social policies.
